	<h4>Technology has transformed music.</h4>

<p id="em1">It has changed the way we create.</p>
<p id="em1">And it has changed the way we share.</p>

<p>A new depth of control over sound provides the artist today with unique and boundless creative challenges, while these same electronic music technologies make music production easier, faster, and more accessible for creators and artists around the world. The rate and pace at which new music is being made increases every day alongside the steady increase of the number and variety of people making it. This prodigious output of music is catalyzed by technological innovations in communication and media, especially the Internet, which have the traditional music industry model scrambling for relevance. The digital revolution is putting power back into the hands of the people that deserve and need it the most--the creators.</p>

<p>For the listeners, this transformation means that there's a lot more music out there to be discovered. Unfortunately, the existence of a ton of new music doesn't infer that all of it is good and worth listening to. The truth is, for every truly great, original track, there are a hundred that aren't. Who has three hours to spare to find one song to love? That's where Free Crate comes in.</p>

<p id="em">What is Free Crate's role in this transformation?</p>

<p>	Inspired by the practice of vinyl 'crate-digging,' The Free Crate seeks to recreate the traditional experience of crate-digging, and falling in love with new and unknown music, for the internet age by scouring the internet for the 25 best free mp3 downloads of the week, classifying them by mood, and zipping them up into one downloadable crate that is distributed every Friday to all subscribed emails. Tracks are also available for streaming via The Monthly Haul, which features every track from every crate released in the previous month.</p>

	<p>The ultimate goal of Free Crate is to inspire awareness. I want to help people connect with the things they love--things they might not know exist--and by bridging this gap with the experience of love, to encourage the listener to be more aware of the world around him. To dig deeper.</p>
